Find the next "best" point for every point.
-------------------------------------------
	Consider the relation p, B(p).
	Search for the first point to put in the permutation.
	You can not say that a point must preceed or succeed another without considering, sufficient state.
	Required state - All the points before it, current cg. Since all the points are included in the cg and must be excluded from selection of B(p).
	The new state arrived at Si, with cg - ci depends not only the point Pi chosen, but also on all points before it.
	There is no Markovian property here.
	Look at solutions to selection of a specific permutation with respect to an objective function.
		Here it is minimizing the interval of c_i.
		Or the distance moved between c_i-1 and c_i.
